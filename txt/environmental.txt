<h2>Environmental Factors</h2>

<p>
The antenna will be placed on the roof of EWI. This means that the antenna should be built such that it can survive and be used in this environment. 
To be more specific, this includes temperature, humidity, air pressure and flow, EMI, physical shocks and vibrations and illumination for example.
The most important factors of these are temperature and EMI, as these have the largest impact on the actual functioning of the antenna.
</p>

<p>
The antenna is a whip antenna (short rod) with a length of 50cm. The antenna rod is assumed to be placed on a supporting structure.
The interface is used to split/combine the supply power and the signal power and it is placed close to the antenna.
</p>

<ul>
<li>According to the application description, the antenna should be able to operate between $-25\,. \!. \!.+70^{\circ}$C</li>
<li>The input of the antenna should also be protected against ESD discharge</li>
<li>The -3dB frequency range of the active antenna should equal 10kHz to 30MHz. The 1dB compression level at the output of the amplifier, measured at the input of the receiver should be above +0dBm (0dBm =1mW in $50 \Omega$). </li>
<li>At the antenna input, this should be equivalent with an electrical field strength of $0.45V_{RMS}m^{-1}$</li>

</ul>
